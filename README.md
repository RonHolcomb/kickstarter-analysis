# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
During this analysis we discovered different trends in kickstarter campaigns. We wanted to find out the best way to start a successful campaign. We did this by gathering data from multiple locations and multiple types of campaigns including plays, films, tv shows, etc. We wanted to know exactly what region and type of kickstarter had the most success. From there we analyzed the number of backers compared to the kickstarters goal. We needed to know exactly how high or low we needed to set the bar in order to get the most donations. As a result we have successfuly determined the location to lauch the campaign, what kind of campaign, and a donation goal that will lead to the highest percentage of success.

## A message to Louise
Based on our findings we recommend you launch a campaign in the US for a Play. You should launch this campaign around May - June as these months saw the most success. We found that the average goal for successful campaigns is around $1,100. With this information you should be able to have a successful kickstarter.
